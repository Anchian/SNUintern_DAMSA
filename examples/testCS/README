To prepare correct 'mkgeant4.cc' for specific type of mediator use one of these commands before 'make':
  sed -r 's#DM_TYPE_NAME#DarkPhotons#g' mkgeant4.cc.template > mkgeant4.cc
  sed -r 's#DM_TYPE_NAME#DarkScalars#g' mkgeant4.cc.template > mkgeant4.cc  
  sed -r 's#DM_TYPE_NAME#DarkPseudoScalars#g' mkgeant4.cc.template > mkgeant4.cc
  sed -r 's#DM_TYPE_NAME#DarkAxials#g' mkgeant4.cc.template > mkgeant4.cc
Then launch as usual:
  make
  ./mkgeant4
In case any deviations from reference total cs values are found the output will be a table such as this:
MA(MeV)  OK - 0, ERR - 1  
0.7      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0.8      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0.9      0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 
1   	 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 
2        0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 
4        0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 
6        0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 

Each row is for fixed MA mass(MeV) and E0 energy(GeV) values from {20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160} range.
1 - difference between reference and DMG4 calculated total cs is more than relative delta specified in mkgeant4.cc
0 - difference is within relative delta
